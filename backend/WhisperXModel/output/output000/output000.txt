[SPEAKER_00]: You're never really going to have a stress-free work environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everything has to be 24 7 3 6
[SPEAKER_00]: because at some point you've caused a lot of bad stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real kind of indicator for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to really kind of take a hard stop and figure out how I recharge.

[SPEAKER_01]: David, it's great to have you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Jay, for having me here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited because I really feel like ever since we met I felt like we
[SPEAKER_01]: hit it off right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right away, right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to have you interview me so many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad I get to repay the favour.
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, this time round and.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to ask you just to get up.
[SPEAKER_01]: just to start with some fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to ask you,
[SPEAKER_01]: David, what's something that you're not calm about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of things that I'm not calm about throughout my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in the throws of my...
[SPEAKER_00]: My oldest daughter applying to colleges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I try to appear very calm in front of her and
[SPEAKER_00]: cool and collective, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to be like a helicopter type of parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are times where I'm just like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get in there and say something.
[SPEAKER_00]: but I realize almost like the best thing for her is for her to go through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have to kind of take a backseat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's it's kind of going from where you
[SPEAKER_00]: take the wheel to like you're in the passenger seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're in the backseat kind of peering every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't help myself from like, I don't know when she first learned to drive by like
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, oh, I'm stepping on the brake here and there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing right now that is probably a little stressful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read a study that said
[SPEAKER_01]: we process around 72 gigabytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: of information per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: which the research likened to reading Tolkien's The Hobbit.
[SPEAKER_01]: every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nearly 96,000 words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: then you go no wonder we're overwhelmed no wonder we're burnt out
[SPEAKER_01]: No wonder we're stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have this really brilliant analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: comparing the brain and our mind to a battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walk us through this because I really like this in your book, Recharge the Way You.
[SPEAKER_01]: break it down and explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: recharge came from a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: and we were talking about mental health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just asked her, I said, you know, how's it going with your kids?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she goes, you know, I was talking to my kids and I just said, how's your battery?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wait, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she goes, why I said, how's your battery?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, well, if I asked them how they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the plane fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they're kids, they're just like, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I ask them, like, how's your battery?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, well, it's at like 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: or so you may need a snack because they're little.
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's at 75%, she's like, oh, you're okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: or sometimes they're 25% and they just need something to decompress.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we are talking about it, a light bulb just went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that light bulb that went on was about like,
[SPEAKER_00]: She took something that at times can be charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: and she took something and
[SPEAKER_00]: and really simplified in a way that I think we would all understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked her, I said, can I run with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was like, yeah, sure, whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still laugh about it, Brenda and I, because she's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, wow, you actually took it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, I used it as a theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: go to clients go out and it just kind of resonates with people because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simple and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of draw out any emotions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just says like, hey, how's your battery?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you feeling?
you
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that sometimes that gets lost because
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to make it bigger sometimes than it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really nice when you can kind of just simplify it and just ask you how you how should
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's your battery even more than?
[SPEAKER_01]: how you're doing, like you said, because...
[SPEAKER_01]: I think sometimes we...
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you also mentioned that we can scale everything up to a 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: so everything can feel like it's a 10, it's the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: or everything can feel like, oh, it's just plain old fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you don't have much to play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas when you get a number, walk us through the different breakdowns as you do in the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think when you look at zero to a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very good
[SPEAKER_01]: at feeling zero and maybe a hundred, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it's your
[SPEAKER_01]: kid's wedding, chances are you'll be at 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's like your kid's birthday, like, you're at 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, there's these...
[SPEAKER_01]: joyful, blissful moments in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: that people experience and we go, yeah, that was a hundred moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we all know what a zero moment feels like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lost a loved one.
[SPEAKER_01]: who sadly passed away, you...
[SPEAKER_01]: got, you know, you lost your job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's these very zero moments
[SPEAKER_01]: Walk us through how you break down the zero to a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I tried to do it really simply.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have found, and I'll talk about my own kids at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: when I ask them that question how their battery is
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that they check
[SPEAKER_00]: like most people, they check their phones quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: and at some point it just becomes like a reflex.
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't even know they're checking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they do look at it and the power is down or it goes yellow,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it goes red, they get a little panicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh my God, I gotta charge it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine my surprise when we're in like airports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, going out to people, can I use a little of your charge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've all been there where we don't have a charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I need something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can somebody help me out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most times people are really kind and they'll just, you know, kind of help you, especially if you're a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about then putting it into zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: and I put it into four zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just said,
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're at 75 to 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning that you're in a zone where you're just moving along.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at 50 to 75,
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably in a place where you might need to start to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: how you may want to recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in that 25 to 50,
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to start figuring out, take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to take a walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to put down the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: you may need to stop the litany of Zoom calls that you're on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you find yourself zero to 25,
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real kind of indicator for you to say hey something's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: and I need to really kind of take a hard stop and figure out how I recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recharge can happen in a number of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've often talked about when I've gotten into that zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of almost go for a walk
[SPEAKER_00]: I sometimes go outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take some deep breaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a number of things, sometimes I may need a workout.
[SPEAKER_00]: A workout really helps me to recharge on a personal front.
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone's a little bit different and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: go to different techniques and so in the book
[SPEAKER_00]: I list a lot of things in the book that you may do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may do one, two, three, four, all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're just really techniques for you to figure out what works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, and I really like that breakdown because
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're all better when we're measuring things with numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: specificity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm one of those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the way your phone is charged says so much about you as a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my phone is always charged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm very rarely below
[SPEAKER_01]: 30% or 40% on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I try and monitor my personal health.
[SPEAKER_01]: in a similar way.
[SPEAKER_01]: as I feel myself going below 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's time for an early night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's time to cancel weekend plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I canceled our dinner this evening for that exact reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got back from work yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started work yesterday at like 8.30 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got back from a shoot at 9.30 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: and I knew I had a dinner tonight and I just...
[SPEAKER_01]: said, I'm so sorry, I can't make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I knew I had a busy day today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was interviewing you, I was interviewing another guest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I want to be really present for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really critical stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I need to recharge using your word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to recharge this evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always
[SPEAKER_01]: shifting things to recharge and I love that idea because I think
[SPEAKER_01]: we hear the word rest and
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes we feel guilty, we shouldn't, but we feel guilty like, I don't have time to
[SPEAKER_01]: rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you think of it about recharging, you're reframing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: and going, oh, I do need to recharge because otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: How am I going to give my best tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's funny, you and me are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep my battery pretty charged as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an electric car too.
[SPEAKER_00]: marvel at people who could take that electric car battery down to 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: The head stresses me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stressed out when they tell me these stories of
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the battery down to five percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, seriously?
[SPEAKER_00]: How, I mean, and they're like, oh, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some people it works, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm plugging in that battery every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to make sure I charge that battery up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others will let it go pretty low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's a little bit different that works for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've asked some of my friends who charge it go really low and they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: like, well, if I charge it too much, I get stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay, can work the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to kind of work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: and how you want to recharge and different techniques that you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never really gonna have a stress-free
[SPEAKER_00]: work environment, anxiety, depression, and then starts to lead to physical ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: because we know there's a linkage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could lead to resilience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could lead to growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually could lead to a stronger culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if someone's at a zero when you ask them, how's your battery?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if someone says, I'm at five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm talking about emotionally, mentally, not their car or their phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say to them?
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you?
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate with them some of these tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're at zero, I've learned to like...
[SPEAKER_00]: take the space to give them space so we can actually have a proper conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: if you find someone at a really low percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I may ask that person, like, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you feeling?
[SPEAKER_00]: and most of the time you just want a, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: because then you just want to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that often in the business world as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: not just in the personal world, but in the business world.
[SPEAKER_00]: want a response.
[SPEAKER_00]: or sometimes we don't have the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: to be like, if that person who you're asking the question to says,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing so hot and I'm not doing so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: then what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: when I ask some of these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: to individuals so that I give, I'm ready for that response.
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's I'm not doing well, like a 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of want to frame it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think sometimes you rush through these conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they do tell you they're a five or a 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the best things that I have found is you have to be present for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do such a brilliant job at that, Jay, because
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in this type of environment, we know as we have this one-to-one conversation,
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was telling you I was a five or a zero, you'd be all in on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would hear me out and then you would start to tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's talk about what's causing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had at times where family members have come to me and said, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I'm at a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: and we start to break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, let me put it in another way for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: and we do checks on our phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's things on your phone that drain your battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than other applications and they're like, yeah, it's like when you go and
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple shows you what's draining or taking up all your memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens when you start to delete some of those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what happens when you start to recognize what's causing it like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my battery is much more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's causing that in your in your personal
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to create
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know analogies of different things and so
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't become a space where all we're doing is talking about all the negativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to draw parallels to different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: in everyday life and so that.
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't become such a charged conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the recharge concept as well, where we're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about your mental health.
[SPEAKER_00]: because sometimes some people don't want to talk about their mental health.
[SPEAKER_00]: when we bring up the battery conversation or how to recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a different framing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is something I think you just do brilliantly to bring everyone in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to do the same thing there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to ask you that actually, because I've always felt that with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've always been present with different touch points, whether we're at dinners, events.
[SPEAKER_01]: where even when we've traveled and seen each other when we're in New York for
[SPEAKER_01]: for a dinner for time earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're always present too, and I wonder how do you do that as a busy CEO?
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think you're so right.
[SPEAKER_01]: that when we ask the question, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: we are subconsciously hoping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone just says, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We almost ask the question and expect the response.
[SPEAKER_01]: even before we have a response.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're so right, like that really resonates.
[SPEAKER_01]: with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the truth is sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: Life is fast for most of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, our schedules are back to back to back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are running from dropping your kid to school
[SPEAKER_01]: running to work, picking up the laundry.
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the laundry, whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you actually create space?
[SPEAKER_00]: for these conversations and that's part of being a lot more present.
[SPEAKER_00]: and intentional as leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be curious now.
[SPEAKER_00]: for you as CEO as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're expected to have all the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're expected to make many different types of decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're expected to play roles in HR, but also company strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you take a step back, you can't make every decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's always things that don't that are the unexpected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your car analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you had your car and you were at 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were probably with someone, but in the back of your mind, you're going, how am I going to get home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I going to charge?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could do this probably better than most, but
[SPEAKER_00]: but you still want to be present for that individual that you're with.
[SPEAKER_00]: or your friends that you're with in those conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I find is like, sometimes we as leaders have to make the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we as leaders have to show something that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely brilliantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: is to show a vulnerable side to them and talk about our own stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that many CEOs today aren't vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I for one was not very good at being vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I wrote the book, though, I was
[SPEAKER_00]: just taken back and how.
[SPEAKER_00]: many people who I met for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: were so open and honest and vulnerable with myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got me thinking, well, they can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't I do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I start to show some of that vulnerability,
[SPEAKER_00]: at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I started to get
[SPEAKER_00]: give a little bit of space and more time for that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that then make it just more open for others?
[SPEAKER_00]: and more safe for others to have the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I'm not having that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: and saying, here's my own journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: then they may feel that it's not okay for them to open up as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just be curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a CEO, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've got all these different businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do that with your own employees?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's...
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it comes to the balance, so vulnerability is a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate that because I do agree that.
[SPEAKER_01]: if you create space.
[SPEAKER_01]: to share what you're going through with your teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: then have the permission to do the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I was mentioning when we did a panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: calm coast a month ago or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking about a client of mine that I was coaching who's
[SPEAKER_01]: the CEO of a very large corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'd gone through a transformation, they were saying to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay I'm you know I'm feeling good and I was like great well you should tell your team about your journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're like, how can I tell them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, well, if I tell them, they're going to think I'm weak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no, I
[SPEAKER_01]: promise you they're going to think you're strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're still redefining and reframing strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world today.
[SPEAKER_01]: there are some of us who still see bravado
[SPEAKER_01]: and arrogance and chauvinism as being strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's shifting, but it's shifting very slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: a cultural expectation as well, societal expectation of
[SPEAKER_01]: strength being this.
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of facade, but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of us are now realising that no strength
[SPEAKER_01]: is being able to show both sides and open up and be vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing that really comes to mind when I'm thinking about...
[SPEAKER_01]: being CEO is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think stress can make people work harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: you
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's the right amount of stress that makes someone work better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so true.
[SPEAKER_00]: of stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I just keep checking in with someone and go, have you done it yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you done yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we not there yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did the numbers not triple this?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do that, they're going to feel stressed and they may work harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't mean they work better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, the right amount of stress, and I want to ask you this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to me about the difference between good stress and bad stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how you've been able to harness the right amount when you've got it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the book, actually, I interviewed Dr. Aditi Narakar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you met her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got into this whole conversation of good stress, bad stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: you
[SPEAKER_00]: You stress, good stress versus bad stress, distress.
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know we talked about how
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stress could lead to resilience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could lead to growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually could lead to a stronger culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: you're never really gonna have a stress-free work environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're always gonna have stress at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going to have deadlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have things we're going to want to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not everything has to be just like you said.

[SPEAKER_00]: Your employees are probably not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: superficially not working well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're probably you've caused a lot of bad stress distress in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: that's leading to things like anxiety, depression, and then starts to lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: to physical elements, because we know there's a linkage between.
[SPEAKER_00]: your mental health and your physical health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that becomes a very vicious cycle, especially in the workplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that leads to a lot of unproductivity.
