Even though I try to appear very calm in front of her and cool and collective, you know? And you don't want to be like a helicopter type of parent. There are times where I'm just like, you know, I want to get in there and say something. but I realize almost like the best thing for her is for her to go through it. and I have to kind of take a backseat. And so it's it's kind of going from where you take the wheel to like you're in the passenger seat. and then you're in the backseat kind of peering every once in a while. But I can't help myself from like, I don't know when she first learned to drive by like saying, oh, I'm stepping on the brake here and there, right? That's one thing right now that is probably a little stressful.",

And she goes, you know, I was talking to my kids and I just said, how's your battery? And I was like, wait, what? And she goes, why I said, how's your battery? I said, why? And she said, well, if I asked them how they're doing. I get the plane fine. And because they're kids, they're just like, I'm fine. But if I ask them, like, how's your battery? They're like, well, it's at like 50%. or so you may need a snack because they're little. or it's at 75%, she's like, oh, you're okay. or sometimes they're 25% and they just need something to decompress. While we are talking about it, a light bulb just went out.

You know, I have found, and I'll talk about my own kids at times. when I ask them that question how their battery is I noticed that they check like most people, they check their phones quite often. and at some point it just becomes like a reflex. and they don't even know they're checking it. But when they do look at it and the power is down or it goes yellow, or it goes red, they get a little panicked. Like, oh my God, I gotta charge it. Imagine my surprise when we're in like airports. And they're like, going out to people, can I use a little of your charge, right? I think we've all been there where we don't have a charge. And you're like, I need something. Can somebody help me out? Most times people are really kind and they'll just, you know, kind of help you, especially if you're a kid. I thought about then putting it into zones. and I put it into four zones. And I just said, You know, if you're at 75 to 100. You're probably fine. meaning that you're in a zone where you're just moving along. If you're at 50 to 75, You're probably in a place where you might need to start to think about how you may want to recharge. If you're in that 25 to 50, It's time to start figuring out, take a break. You may need to take a walk. You may need to put down the phone. you may need to stop the litany of Zoom calls that you're on right now. Right? And if you find yourself zero to 25, That's a real kind of indicator for you to say hey something's probably not right. and I need to really kind of take a hard stop and figure out how I recharge. And recharge can happen in a number of different ways. And so I've often talked about when I've gotten into that zone, I just kind of almost go for a walk I sometimes go outside. I take some deep breaths. I do a number of things, sometimes I may need a workout. A workout really helps me to recharge on a personal front. and everyone's a little bit different and they'll go to different techniques and so in the book I list a lot of things in the book that you may do. You may do one, two, three, four, all of them. and they're just really techniques for you to figure out what works for you.",

And I may ask that person, like, how are you doing? How are you feeling? and most of the time you just want a, I'm good. because then you just want to keep going. And I find that often in the business world as well. not just in the personal world, but in the business world. want a response. or sometimes we don't have the time. to be like, if that person who you're asking the question to says, I'm not doing so hot and I'm not doing so well. then what do you do? So I'm very intentional. when I ask some of these questions. to individuals so that I give, I'm ready for that response. if it's I'm not doing well, like a 5%. So I kind of want to frame it there. I think sometimes you rush through these conversations. And then when they do tell you they're a five or a 10, I think the best things that I have found is you have to be present for them. You have to listen. You do such a brilliant job at that, Jay, because Even in this type of environment, we know as we have this one-to-one conversation, If I was telling you I was a five or a zero, you'd be all in on this. And you would hear me out and then you would start to tell me Okay, let's talk about what's causing that. And I've had at times where family members have come to me and said, hey, I'm not, I'm at a five. and we start to break it down. And I said, let me put it in another way for you. Think about your phone. and we do checks on our phone. And there's things on your phone that drain your battery. More than other applications and they're like, yeah, it's like when you go and Apple shows you what's draining or taking up all your memory. And what happens when you start to delete some of those things? Or what happens when you start to recognize what's causing it like. Oh, my battery is much more efficient. And I'm like, yeah. So what's causing that in your in your personal right now. And we try to create like you know analogies of different things and so It doesn't become a space where all we're doing is talking about all the negativity. We're trying to draw parallels to different things. in everyday life and so that. it doesn't become such a charged conversation. Right. And that's kind of the recharge concept as well, where we're like, Let's talk about your mental health. because sometimes some people don't want to talk about their mental health. when we bring up the battery conversation or how to recharge. It's just a different framing. And again, this is something I think you just do brilliantly to bring everyone in. And I try to do the same thing there as well.",

You're always present too, and I wonder how do you do that as a busy CEO? because I think you're so right. that when we ask the question, how are you doing? we are subconsciously hoping. Someone just says, I'm good. We almost ask the question and expect the response. even before we have a response. You're so right, like that really resonates. with me. And the truth is sometimes Life is fast for most of us. Right, our schedules are back to back to back. We are running from dropping your kid to school running to work, picking up the laundry. doing the laundry, whatever, right? There's so much going on. How do you actually create space?",

We're expected to have all the answers. We're expected to make many different types of decisions. We're expected to play roles in HR, but also company strategy. And when you take a step back, you can't make every decision. And then there's always things that don't that are the unexpected. Take your car analogy. So when you had your car and you were at 30%. You were probably with someone, but in the back of your mind, you're going, how am I going to get home? Where am I going to charge? And you could do this probably better than most, but but you still want to be present for that individual that you're with. or your friends that you're with in those conversations. And what I find is like, sometimes we as leaders have to make the space. Sometimes we as leaders have to show something that you do. Absolutely brilliantly. is to show a vulnerable side to them and talk about our own stories. I find that many CEOs today aren't vulnerable. I for one was not very good at being vulnerable. When I wrote the book, though, I was just taken back and how. many people who I met for the first time. were so open and honest and vulnerable with myself. And it got me thinking, well, they can do it. Why can't I do it? And if I start to show some of that vulnerability, at work. If I started to get give a little bit of space and more time for that conversation. Would that then make it just more open for others? and more safe for others to have the conversation. Because if I'm not having that conversation. and saying, here's my own journey. then they may feel that it's not okay for them to open up as well.",

And I think we're still redefining and reframing strength. in the world today. there are some of us who still see bravado and arrogance and chauvinism as being strong. And I think that's shifting, but it's shifting very slowly. That's right. a cultural expectation as well, societal expectation of strength being this. kind of facade, but I think I think a lot of us are now realising that no strength is being able to show both sides and open up and be vulnerable. I think the other thing that really comes to mind when I'm thinking about... being CEO is. I think stress can make people work harder. you but it's the right amount of stress that makes someone work better.",

        "text": "In the book, actually, I interviewed Dr. Aditi Narakar. And you met her. Yeah, she's wonderful. Fantastic, right? And we got into this whole conversation of good stress, bad stress. you You stress, good stress versus bad stress, distress. and you know we talked about how Good stress could lead to resilience. It could lead to growth. It actually could lead to a stronger culture. you're never really gonna have a stress-free work environment. Agreed. You know, we're always gonna have stress at work. We're all going to have deadlines. going to have things we're going to want to hit. But not everything has to be just like you said. 24 seven 365. because at some point it's going to stack. so much that you as a leader are realizing you're probably not being very efficient. Your employees are probably not working. superficially not working well together. and they're probably you've caused a lot of bad stress distress in their life. that's leading to things like anxiety, depression, and then starts to lead. to physical elements, because we know there's a linkage between. your mental health and your physical health. And so that becomes a very vicious cycle, especially in the workplace. And that leads to a lot of unproductivity. with the two is you really have to find that right balance. and understand there will be and just talk about it. There's a push. We're all going to make a push. We did it recently as a company at Calm. where we are around the elections. And we treated the elections like our Super Bowl moment. because we knew and we saw the data. that people's stress was rising. every day as that day, November 5th, got closer and closer. We saw it in the app store, we saw it in comments, we saw it on social. So we really came together as a company. to do different types of things around that. Take a breath, 30 seconds or 15 seconds of silence. We showed... Animals from the San Diego Zoo on Instagram. And we got so many people commenting that day. that said, hey, thank you for the silence. Thank you for my 15 seconds in this world where. So many things are happening now. People were dialing in from work? Cause they were stressed at work. Stress doesn't just mean it's at home. It was like people were like during the elections coming in from work. And so we wanted to give them a little bit so they had a release so they could be more productive. So there's a lot of things around stuff that I look at for good stress and bad stress and recognize there's always going to be a push pull. But that's the part where you can't do it alone. You gotta have a good team. You gotta talk about it. You do this so well. and make sure that becomes part of your fabric, your culture, your DNA. And I think it's shifting. But it's slow. I think the conversation around mental health in everyday life. It's the most approachable it's ever been. Right. I talk about things with my own kids today around mental health. When I was a child coming you know, I'd be curious like for you, like immigrant family. We didn't talk about our mental health in my household. Right? We talked more about powering through things. and I can talk about that later, but we didn't really talk about it. My kids talk about it. They may overuse it at times, not use it the right way. It's okay. They're having the conversation. Their friends are having the conversation. I think that's great. But when you go to the workplace, it kind of stops. You know, and I go to so many places and I'm like. Do you talk about your mental health at work? And they're like, no. And I'm like, well, let's change that dialogue. Let's make it as approachable as it is in everyday life, and how do we start to do that? Let's give you the tools and we'll start at the top.",

You know, I speak to many CEOs in the Valley. and over the world and, you know, a lot of times I'll ask them, How do you prioritize things with your employees? How transparent are you? And I'll tell you, many of them are not that transparent. or they'll be like, these are the most important things. And then they'll add five more and then five more. And I'll be like, oh, okay. What did you take away? And they're like, what are you talking about? I mean, what did you take away? And they're like... Nothing. And I'm like, well, how do you think that's affecting your employees? And they're like, I never really thought about that. So I've just compounded and stacked the problem. as a leader and you didn't take anything away. and it cascades down like a megaphone. Think about what that employee is going through. and walk in their shoes for a minute. You know, we at the top have the luxury of. of having more control over our schedules. but that person may not have as much control over their schedule. ticking through things. And if you just keep adding. and not taking certain things away and saying, this is important. This isn't important. Here's how I think about it.

Warm welcome, so inviting. and they started to meet the whole all hands off with a meditation. And I wasn't really used to that. And I was I was kind of sitting there and I kind of noticed everyone. And normally we listen to someone like yourself. We'll turn you on. to turn one of our other kind of narrators on, they do great. And everyone just kind of sat there in the moment. And whether it was sometimes it's, you know, really quick 30 seconds, sometimes it's five, six minutes, sometimes three minutes. And they listened and it was. And I kind of was peeking at times looking, I'm like, is everyone kind of closing? their eyes, you know, around here, you know, looking there, and they were just... In the moment was a moment for me that showed me how much they cared. And I was like, wow, this company cares. This isn't forced. You don't have to be here. You don't have to do this. And they were there and they were present and they were in the moment. So that's like some of this that was one of the ways I knew this company was going to be different. And then I watched as the company did things around gratitude. where we end every all hands with gratitude. We read things that have come into us. and it's a reminder of the impact we're having. And I think that's why sometimes I'm so stressed. because I feel this weight of responsibility. where every second of every day someone is using the product. And I just feel like if we're not answering them. We're not helping them in the moment. Someone's not getting something that they need And I feel that stress. And I feel it's really responsibility. And I talk about that with the employees. And I think it's really important to talk about that. There's a gratitude piece at the end. We have Zoom free days. you know, where, where, I talk to employees about, hey, if You're in a moment where you find yourself in five Zooms. Take a beat. You don't need to do that and if there's meetings that don't make sense just like you did tonight which was great. Just say no, it's okay. You know, we'll figure it out. And I do that too.

And I was like, really? And he's like, yeah. Like, Steve asked that we make our own business cards. And I wrote Chief Listening Officer. And I sat there and I was like, wow, that's... That was great. You listen. And so because so often. you know, you just start talking And he's like, no, I became a lot more purposeful. If I just listen first, said probably less. But that impact was greater because I heard what was happening. And I thought that was great. Jack Rowe, who's a former CEO of Aetna in the book, he came over and he said, Sometimes you have to put yourself into neutral. And he's like, and you have to give yourself space because you can't run at 100 miles an hour. And if you don't give yourself a little bit of a break, no matter what position you're in. You're going to find yourself. upside down and you're not going to figure out how to turn back up. And I. I appreciated those conversations with them. because they're a little bit more old school in their approach. they they think we're a little bit more in the middle now and then there's a younger generation that's coming up who thinks about things completely different. It's been such a privilege to be able to kind of talk to so many different people. who are in that in that continuum. to kind of hear how they're managing it, right? even like how you think about things today and how you manage all that. Right, it just must be a lot coming at you today. from many different angles when they're like, Jay, what do you do?",

In one sense, I feel like that's all a leader. actually has to do is be the coach. therapist, support system. them or provide and bring those things in for the team and you almost become a coach. And yes, you're being strategic. Yes, you're being a visionary, but a lot of it is just... loving people and supporting people, I find at least. I find like that's what most of my time is taken up. 100%. Because everyone has their emotions. And as long as you have smart people that you're working with. then those people are the people that investing in them as humans. Yeah. is allowing them to do what you trust them to do. That's right. But the thing that's holding them back. is usually something emotional or mental. It's rarely professional that people have challenges and I find it... something they're going through in their personal life. It's a mental block that they have. And if that doesn't get healed and accessed in the workplace... That's going to be the spanner in the works. Like that's going to be the thing that bottle next to process. creates inefficiency, creates a lack of trust. That's the kind of stuff that gets in the way.",

How does it actually get people to do the work that I need them to do? to do. Isn't this just a distraction or? slows them down because I know a lot of organizations just feel like This sounds good in theory, but how does it help? So if we could talk about... her mindfulness and meditation specifically. the programs that exist on Calm. How do they make sense for stress and burnout? And then how do they make strengths for productivity and performance?",

        "text": "Yeah, I mean, I think I have both of those. I'll start with the second one first, because comes up a lot. What I often tell people is when. I'll just use calm as an example. more than half the people that use Calm today come to us for sleep. And they're having moments where they just can't fall asleep. Most of that comes as we know because they're sleeping next to their devices. The devices are constantly beeping. They don't shut them off. I talk about like, it's hard, but I keep my phone outside. my bedroom. Not everyone does that. When I travel, I don't do that. And sometimes it leads to not... a good sleep. And we know when you have a number of those days that start to compound. it could lead to irritability, it could lead to not being as productive the next day when you go to work. because you're just tired, right? You couple that at times with potentially bad eating habits. or some people drinking habits or other types of habits that aren't and that doesn't create and it creates kind of like what I call negative. behavior. I had that when I was younger because I didn't understand some of these tools. And I just wish I had some of these tools when I was younger. Because I didn't do those things that created positive behavior change. When I was in banking, for example, and when I got stressed. I turned to smoking and I was just... kid and I was like smoking in the stairwell of Salomon Brothers. I shouldn't have been smoking in the stairwell. That's number one. I talked about this with our employees saying, hey, I didn't have apps like com or tools to help me in the moment. I wish I did. I probably would have turned to other things and understood that's. positive behavior that I could turn to, not negative behavior. And if I have enough of that, then it starts to kind of change the pendulum. because I then ended up on a very slippery slope. you know, you're smoking, you start to drink a little bit more, then I'm I'm eating more at odd hours and then I try to go to sleep. And you just know if you're trying to eat Chinese food at 1130 and you want to go to bed at 12 or 1230 you're not going to sleep well because there's just a lot of stuff just sitting there. right, keeping you awake. And so For me, it's been this continuous kind of learning. and we talk about some of these things and I think in the workforce, it's no different. Because then people got to show the kids off to school in the morning and you got to make breakfast. got to do all these things. You kind of need good sleep at night. And it starts, I think, a lot there. And then during the day... We need breaks. and it's in the book that you... that our brain has endless capacity. It's just not true. We don't have endless capacity. you know, our brain, like everything else. needs to recharge. and if you can find ways to recharge. whether it's listening to you every day. Congratulations on over 600 episodes. We were talking about 50. million streams as our chief purpose officer, which I I'm so grateful for because there are times where Those seven minutes for me, where I listen to you. whether it's in the car driving my kids. to school, takes 10 minutes. Some days it takes 30 with traffic. They're moments that I just cherish, or when I'm driving back alone. And it just helps me. then as I start to recenter myself to be more productive during the day. or during the day I take a short break. and I know how to recharge now. whether it's going outside, walking or others, and it makes me so much more productive. because what I find is if I work in a manner and I find myself. falling below 50%, 25% of my battery and I just keep trying to power through. My work gets, it's not very good.",

When I got really stressed or nervous, and most of the time they're around like tests or speaking stuff or front of the class. I just started to get a tightness in my chest, I would... I would get shortness of breath at times. I would sweat in my hands. And I didn't really understand what was happening. And I talked to my mom. you know, and like traditional Korean mother, she would be like, just power through it. And I'm like, okay, I'm just gonna power through it, right? But she didn't know either what was happening. And I don't blame her around that. She just didn't understand in the moment. You know, the reality is when you think about your mental health. It's not about you do, you know. and it's not about powering through the moment. For me, it's about powering up. And that's where the battery analogy keeps coming back in. and I didn't understand some of that. and then you cup and then I have the vocabulary. It wasn't really until I started getting into healthcare that I started to understand. Oh, wow. what you were going through. you've been able to kind of manage it and. through some unhealthy behaviors at times and now you are. doing it through healthy behaviors. but the vocabulary has changed. and you have a better command of that vocabulary.

It's the same things, exams, anything high performance related. I'd feel like my chest got tighter. My heart felt like it wasn't being eating the same, I'd get sweaty palms. And I remember going to the doctors and... They'd wire me up with these monitors, like old school monitors. big things. I'd have to wear it for 24 hours. and I'd go back and they'd be like, oh, he's fine. And I'd be like, but mom, I'm not fine. Like there's something I'm feeling and there was no word for it. So I can very much relate. And again, my mom didn't know what it was either and she was trying her best to help. but we couldn't figure it out. And so I got on with it. And I always have. And then I was thankful enough. to learn mindfulness and meditation many years later that have been My core practices and now. It's not that I don't get nervous before I'm going on stage or a podcast. I still do, but I know what to do. And so I have my breath work. Yeah, I know what I have to look into. It's not that I don't... experience those emotions anymore. But I agree, even in a South Asian family, like I don't think that... vulnerability was normal from parents It wasn't common for uncles and aunts to be that way. And so it created a culture of always putting your best foot forward. and always somewhat being performative. And I think I never subscribed to that, so I started very early on. rebelling and just good for you being myself.",

I mean, you think about those numbers, that's... whether it's two-thirds or one-third. of all people feeling this way. And you start to realize, well, that's heavy. If you were in a room and three out of ten or six out of ten or feeling a certain way you start to realize there's more. That's just why with corporations, I think it's so important. that they can take leadership positions. Again, I always go back to the top on some of these things because... if we're not comfortable being vulnerable. And if we're not comfortable, making sure they are HR teams. have the tools to talk about this with employees initiatives. we're kind of in a place where we're saying, oh, we don't believe some of those stats. but the stats are there and growing, right? And yes, there's, you know, There's life things that are happening, but technology is moving so fast on the other side. I mean, we are definitely in an era right now. where kids have grown up with their smartphones. They act differently. than when I grew up or when you grew up. It's just different. And they grew up with this technology. They're very comfortable with it. the speed of it, which is coming. And then there's the weight of what's happening just in life around them. And so some of these things even at the company level, which are interesting and you don't do this is like. And I found this a little bit with myself. I'll just tell you on a personal front. We're taught to play it very safe. And I think that's an important thing too, I'll tell you a lot of people miss. is that you know, you don't want to say the wrong thing. So you're not going to talk about your own vulnerability? Because that's not playing it down the fair way. You kind of want to be boring, I'll be frank with you, for a lot of leaders. not all leaders, which we know there's a couple of them that are quite, but. for most leaders when you go out there. They're media trained to be right down the fairway. and what I love when I listen and watch your podcast. It's so authentic. It's so real. It's so safe for all the people that listen. And then, and it just shows right with how many people. are tuning in every day, right, and listening to you. doing what I did is like, I'll listen to somebody and then I'll go back to that. I'll be like, Oh, I remember. I'm gonna go back to that. And it's just because... We just play it safe in a lot of places today. and you don't want to say the wrong thing. And I think it's okay, you know, like Even if I was here with you today and maybe something and I didn't say the right thing today. Okay. I'm in a space where I feel so safe with you right now. I just want to be myself and not everything's going to be perfect. Absolutely, right. and that's kind of part of life and I've started to accept that. And I've become much more vulnerable. my own employees to be like, hey, this is okay. And because of that in the last couple of years, we're stronger. We're stronger as a company. We just had a board meeting and they're like, wow, this is great. Everyone's like, Yes, we're doing much better. But I think because we're developing and really building on the right culture. We're asking the right questions and we want to lead by example. Yeah, right.",

You know leaders struggle with how to be vulnerable. And I think it's... generational on a personal, I think the new leaders that are going to rise. the ones in their 20s are going to have no problem. All right. Because when you look at social media today and a lot of the younger generation, they talk about their mental stress. and they talk about their mental health and they're very open about it. Now, again, they may overuse it or, you know. But at least they're having a conversation around it. I think, you know, with other leaders today when I talk to them, They're just like, hey, is it a sign of weakness like you brought up? Is it gonna be used against me. Is someone going to write about it and say, I'm too weak? bored going to think I'm weak as a leader. And I think that is the... that's ultimately also a fail. of corporate stewardship. because they have to also look after your mental health, you know? And so when I'm, you know, I'm fortunate to be on the board of com today. but if I wasn't CEO. I would be asking that CEO, hey, how are you doing? How are you holding up? Let's not talk about the numbers today. You know, I find it really effective when I meet with CEOs and they asked for some coaching. We don't talk about any numbers. We don't talk about the metrics. We just talk about life. and we'll eventually go to that later. But I think when we start with more of a trusting, place where we can understand what's happening around you. then I can be much more thoughtful in the type of advice I give. But this also means I have to create the space and the time to do it, so not everyone has right? And that's That's where I think it's just really important to be really intentional, be really purposeful. in these conversations.",

I went to an event the other day and I had to fly out of town and come back into town and I got back at like four AM. and I worked out the next day and I felt so weak. because I hadn't slept well. Of course. And so at that point I'm glad I still worked out because I needed it but I taught told my trainer I had to get a bit of an easier workout. because I didn't want to push myself when I felt weak. But it's like it takes little adjustments. of figuring out what charge you need right now. I've had a busy week, had a busy weekend. This weekend, I know a recharge means I need no social plans. Like that's what's going to recharge me. And so I wish everyone could just write down while you're listening to this. and while you're reading David's book Recharge you write down one of those most common experiences you feel. when you feel drained, when you feel overwhelmed, when you feel burnt out. And what is your charger? so that you don't have to think about it in the moment, because when you're trying to figure it out in the moment. That's when you get more overwhelmed. Like I know before I go on stage. I always practice breath work. a couple of late nights, I know sleep is the only. charge that's going to solve it, right?",

Five days out of seven, I'm meditating before 9 a.m. and then the other two will be meditating off to 9 a.m. And I like that balance that I have. gratitude, something I'm practicing every single day. Yeah, it's such an important one, I think. We do something with my team that I love every... Friday will do a weekly win. And everyone's encouraged to share what they believe is their win. And sometimes what's amazing about this activity is you feel it will always be like Oh, we had so and so on the podcast or. we won so and so award or... And it isn't. It's actually these little things that people are doing behind the scenes that are not like these grand wins externally. And they believe that that's been their success and I think it's a really great way to actually get to know each other because you get to see what people value as success. And you get to understand what people see as value in the work they do. We just assume that of course if there's a big quarter... then everyone should be excited and it's like, well, maybe not. Right. Because that's not what they equate as their personal success and contribution. Doing the weekly wins on Friday is one of my favourite things to do with my team. It takes like 30 minutes to do. And everyone just goes around my core team and just shares what was their weekly win.",

It's things that you feel that where you sit could move the, for me, could move the business forward in the most meaningful So sometimes it could be helping teams unlock a product decision. Sometimes could be helping teams with things that, partnerships that may move it forward. Other times it may mean things around culture or HR. But it's really being intentional in terms of the types of decisions you're making and where your spending your time. It's not being in every decision with everybody because ultimately They have to make decisions too. One thing we've been doing now that I feel that has really brought the company closer together. is we did this retreat where it wasn't just the leadership team. We brought many different people together. And I said, you guys come up with the company strategy and they were like. And this woman, they were like, what? And I'm like, They're like, don't you have it? My younger self would have been like, here it is. I was like, no, you do it. And I'll tell you, it was so much better than what I was thinking. And it just reminded me again. You hire all these smart people. You take all this time vetting them. doing reference checks, let them do their job. Give them a chance if it was. sports analogy to shoot the ball, give him a chance to play. You know, don't feel like you're keeping them on the bench the whole time and you have to do everything. and give him a shot. And I... I do that great. We rolled it out to the company at that offsite you were at. People came away and said it was the most inspiring offsite. And they were like, you know, that was great. I said, I didn't do it. They did it. It came from the team. And I think it felt so much more meaningful to them because it came from them. and it was so much more spot on and we and really what it was around was We've talked about trying to make the world healthier and happier. we've talked about as a company. trying to be with you every step of the way in your mental health journey. And this was really around how do we become the most impactful consumer mental health company in the world. And when I sat back and said, That's what we want to become. and the team had kind of been the one synthesizing it. Then everyone started mobilizing against it on their own. And they had thought about things that I never even thought about. because I'm just too far sometimes away from the details. And then now I've seen us accelerate. And I know that motion and muscle can be repeated. And you can bring it to other companies regardless of size. And I think sometimes as companies get larger and I've had the fortune of starting my own company, where it's like three of us and then it grows to 30, whatever 300. and then to thousands. And then I have the fortune of joining companies later where it's thousands and it becomes hundreds of thousands. Ultimately, that culture is your bedrock. you know, whether or not how many people you stack on top of it. what you start to set as your foundation. will percolate amongst the entire company. And if you don't do that the right way, and if you're not thought, then you may not get the results that you're happy with, right? and you may create more stressful environments that you just unintentionally didn't think about. And that's where I really appreciate about When leaders come around, they talk about being more thoughtful in their decision-making process. as being more vulnerable, being more open. really thinking about employees' mental health. But then not just talking about it, but then really acting upon it.",

I really... enjoyed our dialogue around recharging and You know, I'm so grateful for the work you're doing at calm because. I remember being a Analyst at Accenture and I'm sure you were really good. I was okay. I was tossed with. teaching meditation in my spare time and mindfulness in my spare time at the company. and I would travel around. and I would do lunchtime sessions and after work sessions. And I couldn't scale myself, but now thanks to Calm. Not only am I able to scale myself to more people, but... We're able to introduce people to so many amazing hosts. and narrators that we have on Calm. and I think inside an organization. You no longer need someone running around the organization physically. trying to serve lots of people, you actually have the ability for everyone to tune in. And we end it. every On Burbars episode with a final five. These questions have to be answered in one word to one sentence maximum. So David Koh, these are your final five. The first question is what is the best recharge advice you've ever heard in your life.",

But this probably was the worst advice she gave me as a child, which was to power through. And it's not about powering through, it's really about powering up. And she didn't know. You know, but you know, mom, I think it was not about powering through. Question number three, what's your three favorite ways to power up? So I have rituals like you. and my rituals in the morning. When I wake up, I don't look at my phone right away. I actually go downstairs, I start the coffee. I open the window and I walk outside. and I take three breaths. and it's been something I've been very intentional about doing. try to open the window, wherever it may be, if you're an apartment or something. That process starts to center me. The second I do is I do a lot of walking meetings and so. I'm a big fan of like trying to break things up that helped me reach her. So people give me energy. I would say going outside breathing, people give me energy. And then lastly, I think similar to yourself. I love to exercise as well and I've become a lot. better at keeping a steady schedule around it and even Someone said this to me the other day. They said, do something every day. Right. And, and I'm like, great, I'm going to do something every day. and I'm going to be really intentional about it and just keep at it. Some days I'll go to the gym, some days I'll do something at home, it'll be really quick. but exercise as well.",

I've definitely tried really hard. really focused on is when me and my wife were together in the evening for dinner and then if we're watching a show or something is not bringing the phone to those two things. things. Because I found myself a lot of the time like finishing off last emails, messaging while we're having dinner. And then when you're watching a show, you're distracted. and then you watch your partner get distracted. and then you're like mad at them for getting distracted. But then when they put their phone down, you've got yours up and they're mad at you for getting distracted. What are we doing here? to notice just my attention span just dropping. I've noticed that a lot in the last 12 months more than. any time before and I've really realized so much of it is because of just the speed of consumption. So now it's not even that we're consuming a lot. we're consuming a lot at a really fast rate. And so you're just making it easier for your mind to get... two seconds of everything. And so for me, I I try to make my weekends very phone free. because weekdays I am on my phone. I've also found that even when I'm with my team if I can I have my laptop in the room, but my laptop's not connected to messaging apps. And then my phone's not in the room. I actually find I'm better with my team. So I can still do email, I can still do work on my laptop, but it's not wired up to WhatsApp. It's not wired up to text message. I don't need it. And so I've been trying to leave my phone actually out of my... hand when I'm not traveling. If I'm going... out for work or driving, of course I need my phone, but if I'm in the office... I don't need my phone on me. in meetings or in between meetings actually. And all of this is stuff I'm still working on too because I find myself go through up ups and downs with it. There are times when I'm brilliant at it. I also follow you. I don't keep my friend in my bedroom. Don't look at it first thing in the morning. Yeah, but I always have days where I break that completely when I'm traveling and so. I don't want to make anyone feel like... I've got it down or perfect because I haven't. And I think it's almost like peaks and troughs. There's always a... A good day and a bad week and a good week and a bad day.",

Beautiful festival. of it every year we had those just so much going on and all good stuff, all stuff I wanted to go to. but I'm very disciplined about my sleep all year round. And at this time of year I kind of let go a little bit because there are so many... wonderful events that I get invited to. And so I've been feeling a bit and as soon as you came in, you took me from a 60 to a 90. 95 easily. And honestly, it's this conversation because it felt... so real, so authentic, so genuine. I felt like... Again, you were really present and I think that's what we don't realize when you're present with someone you're charging them up. while you're being charged. And that's such a superpower that... Often we think, oh, if I'm charging someone else off, I'm losing energy. But that's not true if you're charging someone else else up by being present. You're getting charged up and so are they. And we've both felt that today. And I genuinely felt that today. And honestly, calm has just been... Such a brilliant partner. It's the team I love working with every day, whether it's the content team. the team that we work with in the studio. the team that I get to see once a year, the leadership. Everyone walks the talk there and it's so impressive to me. Thank you. Because I felt it from the moment I started doing Zooms and meetings with everyone at calm and it's remarkable. what you're all doing and I can't wait to be a part of the future. Congratulations and it's just the beginning. getting started. I appreciate it.",
